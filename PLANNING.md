# Roadmap and Completion Plan for AI Code Reviewer System (v2)

## 1. Project Objectives Summary
- Build an advanced AI-powered code review system, multi-agent, supporting both PR and full project scans.
- Combine static analysis (AST, rule-based), LLM (semantic, XAI), RAG (context), diagram generation (class, sequence), risk prediction, and visual reporting.
- Prioritize open-source, modular, extensible design, independent from CI/CD.

## 2. Overall Architecture
- **Orchestrator (LangGraph):** Coordinates multi-agent workflow.
- **Main Agents:**
  - UserInteractionAgent (CLI/web interface, receives scan requests)
  - CodeFetcherAgent (fetches code, diffs, branches, PRs)
  - ASTParsingAgent (AST parsing, multi-language)
  - StaticAnalysisAgent (rule-based, Tree-sitter)
  - LLMOrchestratorAgent (LLM integration, XAI, prompt)
  - RAGContextAgent (chunking, embedding, vector store, knowledge graph)
  - DiagramGenerationAgent (PlantUML/Mermaid, class/sequence diagrams)
  - ImpactAnalysisAgent (change impact analysis)
  - SolutionSuggestionAgent (fix suggestions, explainable)
  - ProjectScanningAgent (full project scan, hierarchical summarization, risk)
  - ReportingAgent (aggregation, report output, markdown/html)
- **Supporting engines/components:**
  - DiagrammingEngine, KnowledgeGraphBuilder, RiskPredictor
  - Vector store (Qdrant/Chroma), Neo4j (graph), SentenceTransformer
- **Frontend:** React (scan creation, report viewing, diagrams, progress)
- **Backend:** FastAPI (scan/report/status APIs)

## 2.1. Modern UI/UX Design (Update May 2025)
- **Design Principles:**
  - Clean, minimal, and distraction-free layout
  - Responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile
  - Use of neumorphism, glassmorphism, or soft shadow effects for depth
  - Smooth transitions, micro-interactions, and animated feedback
  - Accessibility (WCAG 2.2), high contrast, keyboard navigation
- **Color Palette:**
  - Primary: Deep blue (#1A237E), Electric blue (#2979FF)
  - Accent: Emerald green (#00C853), Orange (#FF9100)
  - Background: Light gray (#F5F7FA), White (#FFFFFF), Dark mode (#181A20, #23272F)
  - Text: High contrast, adaptive to light/dark mode
- **Component Style:**
  - Rounded corners, subtle gradients, card-based layout
  - Consistent iconography (Material Symbols, Lucide, or similar)
  - Modern font (Inter, Roboto, or system font stack)
- **User Experience:**
  - Real-time progress indicators, skeleton loading
  - Toast notifications for actions, errors, and completion
  - Contextual tooltips, help overlays, and onboarding
  - Customizable theme (light/dark, color accent switch)

## 2.2. Agent Graph Visualization Feature
- **Agent Graph Display:**
  - Visualize the multi-agent workflow as an interactive graph (nodes = agents, edges = data flow)
  - Use D3.js, Cytoscape.js, or React Flow for rendering
  - Show agent status: idle, running, completed, error (color-coded)
  - Highlight the currently active agent(s) in real-time during scan execution
  - Allow user to click on agent node to view logs, input/output, or explanation
  - Animate transitions as workflow progresses
- **Integration:**
  - Embed agent graph in scan progress/report page
  - Sync with backend orchestrator state (via WebSocket or polling)
  - Optionally allow replay of agent workflow for completed scans

## 3. Current Completion Assessment
### 3.1. Core Engine & Agents
- [x] Orchestrator (LangGraph): Implemented, workflow, state, >80% test coverage
- [x] CodeFetcherAgent: Implemented, supports clone, diff, branch, file filtering
- [x] ASTParsingAgent: Implemented, multi-language (Python, Java, Kotlin, XML, JS, Dart), cache, structure extraction
- [x] StaticAnalysisAgent: Implemented, rule-based, many rules, multi-language
- [x] LLMOrchestratorAgent: Implemented, mock/OpenAI/Gemini, XAI prompt, RAG
- [x] RAGContextAgent: Implemented, chunking, embedding, vector store, knowledge graph
- [x] DiagrammingEngine: Implemented, class/sequence diagram generation, PlantUML/Mermaid
- [x] ReportingAgent: Implemented, aggregation, markdown, json, diagrams
- [x] ProjectScanningAgent: Implemented, hierarchical summarization, risk, full project aggregation
- [x] KnowledgeGraphBuilder: Implemented, build graph from AST, Neo4j
- [x] RiskPredictor: Implemented, risk scoring, aggregation
- [ ] ImpactAnalysisAgent: Not separated yet, partially present in other agents
- [ ] SolutionSuggestionAgent: Exists, but needs more XAI, explainability, and diverse suggestions

### 3.2. Backend API
- [x] Scan API (initiate, status, report, list, delete): Complete, FastAPI, tested
- [x] ScanService: Manages progress, state, returns reports

### 3.3. Frontend
- [x] Scan creation (form, validation, repo/PR/branch/tag input)
- [x] Scan list (progress tracking, status, delete)
- [x] Report viewing (findings, LLM, diagrams, suggestions, filter)
- [x] Diagram display (PlantUML/Mermaid, zoom, pan, interactive)
- [ ] Modern UI/UX (2025 trend) and agent graph visualization (see above)

### 3.4. Testing
- [x] Unit tests for each agent, API, frontend (Pytest, Jest)
- [ ] Tests for edge cases: network errors, LLM errors, vector store errors (to be added)

### 3.5. Documentation
- [x] README, setup guide, architecture, usage examples
- [ ] Guide for extending rules, adding languages, custom prompts (to be added)

## 4. Outstanding/Missing Points
- ImpactAnalysisAgent not clearly separated
- SolutionSuggestionAgent needs better explainability, more diverse suggestions
- No rule management UI/user permission (if needed)
- No tests for special error cases (LLM timeout, vector store down, etc.)
- No detailed guide for extending (rules, languages, diagrams)
- No automated CI/CD pipeline for test/deploy
- **Modern UI/UX and agent graph visualization not yet implemented**

## 5. Next Development Directions
- Add/separate ImpactAnalysisAgent, upgrade SolutionSuggestionAgent
- Add tests for edge/system error cases
- Write more documentation for extension (custom rules, prompts, languages)
- Build CI/CD pipeline for automated testing, build, deploy
- Consider adding rule management UI, user permission (if needed)
- Optimize performance for large codebases, reduce LLM cost
- **Implement modern UI/UX and agent graph visualization as described above**
