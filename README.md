# **AI-Powered In-Depth Code Review System**

## **Project Overview**

This project aims to develop a sophisticated, AI-driven system for in-depth code review. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) analysis, the system is designed to provide deep semantic understanding of code changes, identify potential issues, and offer actionable solutions. It supports on-demand scanning for both individual Pull Requests (PRs) and entire projects.

The core mission is to significantly improve code quality, enhance developer productivity, and maintain the integrity of software architecture. By offering comprehensive, automated analysis, the system helps in proactively identifying risks, reducing technical debt, and accelerating development cycles.

## **Key Features**

* **Deep Semantic Analysis:** Utilizes LLMs for a nuanced understanding of code logic, intent, and potential bugs beyond simple static checks.  
* **Hybrid Analysis Model:** Combines the structural precision of AST-based analysis with the contextual understanding of LLMs and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).  
* **Multi-Agent Architecture:** Employs a system of specialized AI agents (orchestrated by LangGraph) to handle distinct tasks in the review process, such as code fetching, parsing, static analysis, LLM interaction, and report generation.  
* **Actionable Error Resolution:** Focuses on generating clear, context-aware, and practical suggestions to help developers easily fix identified issues.  
* **Automated Architectural Diagramming:** Generates class diagrams and sequence diagrams (using PlantUML/Mermaid.js) to visualize code structure, changes within a PR, and their potential impact on the existing architecture.  
* **On-Demand Scanning:** Allows users (developers, tech leads) to initiate scans for specific PRs (open or closed) or entire projects as needed.  
* **Comprehensive Reporting:** Produces detailed reports in human-readable formats (Markdown, HTML) and potentially machine-readable formats (SARIF), summarizing findings, proposed solutions, and architectural visualizations.  
* **Standalone & Self-Hosted:** Designed to operate as an independent tool, self-hosted by the user to ensure data privacy and control over proprietary code. It does not directly integrate into CI/CD pipelines, acting as an offline analysis and reporting tool.  
* **Open Source Prioritization:** Built with a strong preference for open-source technologies and components.  
* **Initial Language Support:** Python, Java, Kotlin (including Android-specific analysis).

## **Strategic Value**

This system moves beyond traditional linters and basic static analysis tools by:

* Providing proactive and in-depth code quality assurance.  
* Offering insights into architectural health and potential risks.  
* Reducing the manual effort in code reviews, allowing senior developers to focus on more complex design challenges.  
* Facilitating a culture of high-quality engineering and continuous improvement.

This project is based on the research and design outlined in "Report: AI-Based In-Depth Code Review System â€“ Design and Roadmap (May 2025)".
